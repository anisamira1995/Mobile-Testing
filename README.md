Robot Framework is a generic automation framework designed for a significant number of applications. You can use the framework for testing apps on the web — both on mobile and desktop — and much more.

The idea behind this framework is that automation must be independent of operating systems and applications. This means that you can use it to automate Linux, Windows, Mac, and other applications and use libraries written in your favorite programming languages, Python or Java.

Test cases are simple text files with a robot extension. You can edit them in your favorite integrated development environment. PyCharm with Robot Plugin is excellent for writing Robot Framework test cases because it offers syntax highlighting and other benefits that help you write cases.
